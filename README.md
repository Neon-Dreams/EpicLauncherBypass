# EpicLauncherBypass
This is a project that aims to remove the need for launching games via the Epic Games launcher by logging the command line arguements produced when Epic launches a game.  This can then be incorporated into a batch file to create an alternative launcher not requiring the Epic Launcher

THIS DOES NOT WORK FOR ALL GAMES

MULTIPLAYER WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE AS FAR AS I'M AWARE

Also be a nice person.  Only use this on games you already own.  Don't steal from the developers.  How would you like it if I took food out of your mouth?
